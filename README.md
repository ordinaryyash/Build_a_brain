# 🧠 Building a Brain in 10 Minutes – NVIDIA Colab AI Demo

This project is a hands-on implementation of a neural network using NVIDIA's "Building a Brain in 10 Minutes" course, run entirely on Google Colab.

## 🚀 What It Does
- Creates and trains a basic neural network (multi-layer perceptron)
- Runs live inference in Google Colab
- Demonstrates how edge AI can be prototyped in minutes using NVIDIA's toolchain

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NVIDIA’s teaching tools

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Understanding model architecture and layers
- Setting up a neural net in < 10 minutes
- Importance of GPU-accelerated workflows for AI

## 💼 Why It Matters
Though this course doesn’t offer certification, the experience is highly practical. I completed the entire module and deployed a live neural network, proving that I can quickly understand and apply core deep learning concepts.
